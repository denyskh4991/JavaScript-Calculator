<h2>Key Features</h2>
<h3>- Arithmetic Operations</h3>
The app supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers and operators directly through the calculator interface, and the results are displayed instantly when the "=" button is pressed. 
<h3>- User Interface</h3>
<h4>Display</h4>
The calculator features a large display area where the current input and result are shown. This display is styled for clarity, with a large font size to ensure readability. <h4>Buttons</h4> The calculator includes buttons for digits (0-9), basic operators (+, -, *, /), and special functions like "AC" (All Clear) and "DE" (Delete). Each button is styled with a modern design, ensuring ease of use and visual appeal. 
<h3>- Special Functions</h3>
<h4>Clear and Delete</h4>
The "AC" button clears the entire input, allowing users to start a new calculation. The "DE" button allows users to delete the last entered character, providing greater control over input. 
<h4>Decimal Point</h4>
A dedicated button for the decimal point (.) allows users to perform calculations with floating-point numbers.

<h4>Button and Input Styling</h4>
Buttons are designed with rounded corners, padding, and shadow effects, providing a tactile and visually pleasing interface. 
<h2>Technical Overview</h2>
<h3>- HTML Structure</h3>
The HTML document is structured around a central `div` container (`.container`) that houses the calculator interface. Key components include the display area and multiple rows of buttons for input. 
<h3>- CSS Styling</h3>
The CSS file defines the visual layout and design elements of the calculator: <h4>Container Layout</h4> The container is centered on the page using CSS flexbox, ensuring the calculator is prominently displayed and easy to use. 
<h4>Color and Typography</h4>
The application employs a dark theme with light-colored text to create a visually appealing contrast. The "Poppins" font is used to ensure readability. <h4>Responsive Design</h4> The layout uses flexible units and media queries to adjust to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices. 
<h3>- JavaScript Functionality</h3>
The interactivity of the calculator is powered by JavaScript
<h4>- Button Click Events</h4>
Each button is tied to an `onclick` event that updates the display with the corresponding value or performs a calculation when the "=" button is pressed. 
<h4>- Evaluation of Expressions</h4>
The "=" button triggers the evaluation of the input expression using the `eval()` function, displaying the result in the input field. 
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This Calculator application provides a simple, modern solution for basic arithmetic operations. With its intuitive design, responsive layout, and clean user interface, the app offers a seamless and enjoyable user experience, making it a practical tool for quick calculations on any device.
